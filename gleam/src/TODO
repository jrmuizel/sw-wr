Make `wrench --no-picture-caching show rect.yaml` work
- Display the output somehow. (write a png)

Next:
- make `wrench --no-picture-caching show benchmarking/text-rendering.yaml' work
- handle different shaders
- handle different features
- specialize texture samplers some how. i.e. we want to know at compile time what the format of a texture is
- investigate larger tiles:
 llvmpipe runs the shader 4 times to get a 4x4 block of pixels
 that it can convert to integers and then shuffle into the right
 order


Future
- mask texture loads
- add quad primitive
