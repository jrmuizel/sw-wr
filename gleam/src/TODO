Make `wrench --no-picture-caching show rect.yaml` work
- implement vertex attribute interpolation (can copy tinyrenderer if needed here)
- implement pixel shader parallelization (currently we're only using one lane)
- implement output merger/blend
 - llvmpipe runs the shader 4 times to get a 4x4 block of pixels
 that it can convert to integers and then shuffle into the right
 order

Next:
- make `wrench --no-picture-caching show benchmarking/text-rendering.yaml' work
- handle different shaders
- handle different features
- specialize texture samplers some how. i.e. we want to know at compile time what the format of a texture is

Future
- mask texture loads
- add quad primitive
