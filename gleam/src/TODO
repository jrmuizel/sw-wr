Make `wrench --no-picture-caching show rect.yaml` work
- debug frag shader
- implement input assembly
- implement rasterization/vertex interpolation (can copy tinyrenderer if needed her)
- get fragment shaders running
- implement output merger/blend
 - llvmpipe runs the shader 4 times to get a 4x4 block of pixels
 that it can convert to integers and then shuffle into the right
 order
- specialize texture samplers some how. i.e. we want to know at compile time what the format of a texture is

Future
- mask texture loads
- add quad primitive
